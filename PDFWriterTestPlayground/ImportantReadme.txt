Hey!
make sure you setup the following before running tests:
1. Have a folder named c:\PDFLibTests. this is where all the output files will be written to.
2. Create under c:\PDFLibTests a folder names TestMaterials.
3. download TestMaterials.zip package and extract to place the sample files in c:\PDFLibTests\TestMaterials
