Hey!
make sure you setup the following before running tests:
1. Have a folder named c:\PDFLibTests. this is where all the output files will be written to.
2. Copy the TestMaterials folder found under PDFWriterTestPlayground folder to the newly created folder (it should now appear as c:\PDFLibTests).
	you can use this folder to place files that shuld be used as input for tests.
